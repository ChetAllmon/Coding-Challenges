# Coding-Challenges
A collection of Coding Challenges I have completed. The challenges can be sourced from anywhere, but the majority will be from Daily Coding Problems. https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/

All code will be written with the Java language on the Eclipse IDE.

I will make two attempts per Challenge. One without outside help. One with outside help, in order to find a better solution.

This collection serves as a library for myself, to see how I improve over time. As well as for potentional employers to view and see my code.
